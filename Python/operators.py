#                                       Arithmetic Operator
'''  Arithmetic Operator in python are same as other language only the addons are 
1.  float division (/)  : Performs divison and floating point result is shown
2.  floor division (//) : Performs divison and integer result is shown
3.  modulus        (%)  : Modulus obtain reminder after division

#Examples: 
a = 55
b = 10

print(a+b)      #addtion
print(a-b)      #substraction
print(a/b)      #float division
print(a//b)     #floor division
print(a%b)      #modulus
print(a*b)      #multiplication


#                                   Comparision Operator
c = 2
d = 6

print("Is c>d?  :",c>d)         #Greater than 
print("Is c<d?  :",c<d)         #Less than
print("Is c>=d? :",c>=d)        #Greater equal to 
print("Is c<=d? :",c<=d)        #Less than equal to
print("Is c==d? :",c==d)        #Equals to 
print("Is c!=d? :",c!=d)        #Not Equal to 


#                                  Assignment Operator
